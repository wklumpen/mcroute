Matrices and Vectors
====================

Markov chains require extensive manipulation and multiplication of matrices.
MCRoute provdes a collection of useful methods for creating and populating
transition probability matrices to attach to nodes and edges in the network,
and probability vectors to use as initial conditions. These modules can be found
in the :mod:`mcroute.matrix` and :mod:`mcroute.vector` libraries respectively.
