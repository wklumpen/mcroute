Installation 
============

MCRoute requires Python 3.8 or above. We have assumed that you have a default
Python environment already configured on your computer, and you intend to
install ``mcroute`` inside of it.

First, make sure you have the latest version of ``pip`` installed. You can then
install the current release of ``mcroute`` with ``pip``:

.. code-block::

   $ pip install mcroute

To upgrade to a newer release use the --upgrade flag:

.. code-block::

   $ pip install --upgrade mcroute

If you do not have permission to install software systemwide, you can install 
into your user directory using the ``--user`` flag:

.. code-block::

   $ pip install --user mcroute
